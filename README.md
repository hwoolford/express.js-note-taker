# Express.js Note Taker

## Description
This project involves building the backend for an existing frontend application. The backend for this note-taking app was built using JavaScript, JSON, and node.js.

Once the application is initialized, users are directed to a notetaking landing page. After clicking the "Get Started" button, users are presented with previous notes on the left, and a UI to write a new note. Users will then enter a title and some text and save the note. The new note will appear under the existing saved notes.

## Usage
In order to use this application, you must have node.js installed on your machine. You will also need a package.json with the required dependencies. Before installing dependencies, run "npm init" to create a package.json file. Also before installing npm dependencies, make sure you have a .gitignore file that includes node_modules/ and .DS_Store/. After running npm init, then run "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies.

The GIF below shows the functionality of the notetaking application.
